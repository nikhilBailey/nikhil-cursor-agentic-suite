# Cursor user rules

Exported from Cursor Settings (user scope). After a restore, paste each rule
back into Settings → Rules. `scripts/backup.sh` does not refresh this file;
update it by hand when Settings rules change.

## Git commit protocol

Only create commits when requested by the user. If unclear, ask first. When the user asks you to create a new git commit, follow these steps carefully:

Git Safety Protocol:

- NEVER update the git config
- NEVER run destructive/irreversible git commands (like push --force, hard reset, etc) unless the user explicitly requests them in the user query or in a different user rule
- NEVER skip hooks (--no-verify, --no-gpg-sign, etc) unless the user explicitly requests it in the user query or in a different user rule
- NEVER run force push to main/master, warn the user if they request it
- Avoid git commit --amend. ONLY use --amend when ALL conditions are met:
  1. User explicitly requested amend, OR commit SUCCEEDED but pre-commit hook auto-modified files that need including
  2. HEAD commit was created by you in this conversation (verify: git log -1 --format='%an %ae')
  3. Commit has NOT been pushed to remote (verify: git status shows "Your branch is ahead")
- CRITICAL: If commit FAILED or was REJECTED by hook, NEVER amend - fix the issue and create a NEW commit
- CRITICAL: If you already pushed to remote, NEVER amend unless the user explicitly requests it in the user query or in a different user rule (requires force push)
- NEVER commit changes unless the user explicitly asks you to in the user query or in a different user rule. It is VERY IMPORTANT to only commit when explicitly asked, otherwise the user will feel that you are being too proactive.

1. You can call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested, batch your tool calls together for optimal performance. ALWAYS run the following shell commands in parallel, each using the Shell tool:
 - Run a git status command to see all untracked files.
 - Run a git diff command to see both staged and unstaged changes that will be committed.
 - Run a git log command to see recent commit messages, so that you can follow this repository's commit message style.
2. Analyze all staged changes (both previously staged and newly added) and draft a commit message:
 - Summarize the nature of the changes (eg. new feature, enhancement to an existing feature, bug fix, refactoring, test, docs, etc.). Ensure the message accurately reflects the changes and their purpose (i.e. "add" means a wholly new feature, "update" means an enhancement to an existing feature, "fix" means a bug fix, etc.).
 - Do not commit files that likely contain secrets (.env, credentials.json, etc). Warn the user if they specifically request to commit those files
 - Draft a concise (1-2 sentences) commit message that focuses on the "why" rather than the "what"
 - Ensure it accurately reflects the changes and their purpose
3. Run the following commands sequentially:
 - Add relevant untracked files to the staging area.
 - Commit the changes with the message.
 - Run git status after the commit completes to verify success.
4. If the commit fails due to pre-commit hook, fix the issue and create a NEW commit (see amend rules above)

Important notes:

- NEVER update the git config
- NEVER run additional commands to read or explore code, besides git shell commands
- DO NOT push to the remote repository unless the user explicitly asks you to do so in the user query or in a different user rule
- IMPORTANT: Never use git commands with the -i flag (like git rebase -i or git add -i) since they require interactive input which is not supported.
- If there are no changes to commit (i.e., no untracked files and no modifications), do not create an empty commit
- In order to ensure good formatting, ALWAYS pass the commit message via a HEREDOC, a la this example:

```
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
Commit message here.

EOF
)"
```

## Pull request protocol

Use the gh command via the Shell tool for ALL GitHub-related tasks including working with issues, pull requests, checks, and releases. If given a Github URL use the gh command to get the information needed.

IMPORTANT: When the user asks you to create a pull request, follow these steps carefully:

1. You can call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested, batch your tool calls together for optimal performance. ALWAYS run the following shell commands in parallel using the Shell tool, in order to understand the current state of the branch since it diverged from the main branch:
 - Run a git status command to see all untracked files
 - Run a git diff command to see both staged and unstaged changes that will be committed
 - Check if the current branch tracks a remote branch and is up to date with the remote, so you know if you need to push to the remote
 - Run a git log command and `git diff [base-branch]...HEAD` to understand the full commit history for the current branch (from the time it diverged from the base branch)
2. Analyze all changes that will be included in the pull request, making sure to look at all relevant commits (NOT just the latest commit, but ALL commits that will be included in the pull request!!!), and draft a pull request summary
3. Run the following commands sequentially:
 - Create new branch if needed
 - Push to remote with -u flag if needed
 - Create PR using gh pr create with the format below. Use a HEREDOC to pass the body to ensure correct formatting.

```
# First, push the branch
git push -u origin HEAD

# Then create the PR
gh pr create --title "the pr title" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
<1-3 bullet points>

## Test plan
[Checklist of TODOs for testing the pull request...]

EOF
)"
```

Important:

- NEVER update the git config
- DO NOT use the TodoWrite or Task tools
- Return the PR URL when you're done, so the user can see it

## Web app verification

When implementing or fixing anything in a web application (UI, layout, styling, routing, client state, or rendered data), verify your work in the browser before declaring the task complete.

**Use this verification workflow:**
- Open the app with the available browser tools and exercise the changed feature end to end the way a real user would: click, type, submit, navigate.
- A single render screenshot of the changed screen is NOT verification. Confirm behavior, not just appearance.
- Check every page and route that shares the state, data, or components you touched. Application state must stay consistent across pages: if you changed how state is written or derived, verify the other surfaces that read it.
- Hunt for regressions. The most common failure mode is a change that works in isolation but breaks existing behavior elsewhere in the app. Navigate the surrounding flows and look for what broke.
- Verify the paths and edge states your change touches (empty states, error states, route and flag variants), not only the main path.
- When layout or styling changed, consider whether you need to verify both desktop and mobile viewports.
- If verification finds a problem, fix it and re-verify. Do not finish with unverified UI work.

If no browser tools are available, verify through the closest available substitute (tests, curl against the dev server, rendering scripts) and say what you could not verify.

## Pre-commit review

Before creating a git commit (when I ask you to commit), follow the pre-commit-review skill. Do not commit until both gates are green or I explicitly waive the review. If the skill escalates, stop and ask me rather than committing.
